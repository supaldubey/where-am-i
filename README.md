Where am I, helps you fetch your current location address and displays it.

![Splash / Launcher screen](https://sayingimages.com/wp-content/uploads/jackie-chan-wait-what-meme.jpg "meme")


Few reasons: 
- Just brushing up Flutter skills.
- Had a draft project for something else, repurposed for something I needed.
